# Bradford Construction Management - ADU Content Guidelines

**Last Updated:** December 16, 2024  
**Purpose:** Strategic reference for all ADU content creation (website, ads, lookbook, social)

---

## Strategic Context

### The Shift (December 2024)
We're broadening website ADU messaging from aging-in-place focus to capture ALL ADU demand while preserving paid funnel performance.

**Why:** Conversion leak identified. Prospects don't realize BCM customizes every ADU. Rick: "How many people didn't call because they're like, oh, they don't have a two bedroom option?"

**Key Insight:** Every ADU BCM has designed has deviated from standard layouts (garage underneath, two bedrooms, attached units, etc.)

### Content Strategy Split

| Channel | Focus | Rationale |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| **Website ADU page** | Broad appeal, all use cases | Cast wide net, capture all interest |
| **Paid landing pages** | Aging-in-place specific | Don't touch what's working in current funnel |
| **Lookbook** | Showcase range + customization | Support both channels |
| **Social/organic** | Rotate through all ICPs | Build awareness across segments |

## Target Audiences (Priority Order)

1. **Aging-in-place families** - KEEP as primary, proven converter
2. **Rental income seekers** - Growing segment, property ROI angle
3. **Multi-generational living** - Adult kids launching, boomerang situation
4. **Remote work/studio** - Home office separation need
5. **Vacation property owners** - NH/ME expansion market

---

## Core Messaging Requirements

### Must Communicate

1. **Customization is standard** - Every project modified to client needs
2. **Range of configurations** - Two-story, attached, garage underneath, connected breezeway
3. **BCM + BHS lifetime support** - Build it AND maintain it (unassailable differentiator)
4. **Professional project management** - Daily documentation, commercial-grade PM
5. **Regional expertise** - MA and NH, expanding to vacation markets

### Avoid/Soften

- MA-specific financing barriers (modification loan limitations)
- Overly narrow use case framing
- Cookie-cutter/prefab implications
- Generic ADU industry language that doesn't differentiate

---

## Architectural Models Reference

### ELM Family (Single-Story)
- **Footprint:** 32' x 19' approximately
- **Livable SF:** 514-600 SF

---

## Voice of Customer Alignment

### Pain Points to Address (from VoC research)
- 73% mention communication fears - counter with daily documentation
- 47% fear post-completion abandonment - counter with BHS lifetime support
- Budget surprise anxiety - counter with transparent pricing
- "Will it feel cramped?" - counter with smart design, vaulted ceilings, natural light

### Language That Converts (use these phrases)
- "Never get ghosted"
- "Daily photo documentation"
- "Bradford For Life"
- "Designed for your property"
- "Your style, your ADU"
- "Close enough to help, private enough to live"

### Language to Avoid
- Generic: "quality craftsmanship," "attention to detail"
- Salesy: "dream home," "luxury living"
- Prefab implications: "models," "units," "packages" (use "designs," "layouts," "options")

---

## Visual Content Guidelines

### What Current Assets Show Well
- Architectural variety (4 roof styles)
- New England suburban context
- Fall foliage setting
- Quality finishes and materials

### Gaps to Fill (New Imagery Needed)
1. **People/lifestyle** - Current renders are empty, need emotional connection
2. **Interiors** - Prospects can't visualize living inside
3. **Different settings** - Mountain/ski (NH market), winter, coastal
4. **Customization visible** - Attached to main house, breezeway, garage underneath
5. **Accessibility signals** - Zero-step entry, wider doors (subtle, not clinical)

### Image Style Consistency
- Photorealistic architectural photography
- Golden hour or soft natural lighting preferred
- New England context (fall foliage, mature trees, privacy fencing)
- Hydrangeas and ornamental grasses in landscaping
- Scale references that keep structures modest (6' fence, mature trees)

---

## Content by Funnel Stage

### Top of Funnel (Awareness)
- Use case variety - show ADUs solving different problems
- Aspirational imagery
- "Did you know?" educational hooks
- Broad geographic targeting

### Middle of Funnel (Consideration)
- Customization messaging prominent
- Process transparency (daily documentation)
- BCM + BHS differentiator
- Specific model/design information

### Bottom of Funnel (Decision)
- Social proof and testimonials
- Timeline and process clarity
- Consultation CTA
- "Never get ghosted" trust messaging

---

## Competitive Positioning

### BCM's Unassailable Advantage
No competitor has a dedicated service division for post-completion support. BCM + BHS = "build it AND maintain it forever."

### How Competitors Position
- Walczak: Design-focused, aesthetic emphasis
- Burdey's: General ADU contractor
- Backyard ADUs: Category specialist

### BCM's Counter-Position
Professional project management (commercial background) + lifetime support (BHS) + customization standard. Not just beautiful design - accountable execution and permanent relationship.
