> Absolutely beautiful work done by Moore Electric. Beside installing some difficult pieces, they were extremely neat, organized and displayed great attention to the details. They installed a sub panel and updated old wiring as well. All workers were very respectful of our property and our time. The owner Brendan and his team, (Liam and Max) listened to our request and went above and beyond. We would definitely hire this very professional team again.

*January 2026*

> We recently purchased a home that required a complete second-floor renovation, and Moore Electric Inc. was outstanding from start to finish. The scope of work was extensive, including removing and replacing all old knob-and-tube wiring with new, fully code-compliant wiring, hardwiring new smoke detectors, and installing all new light fixtures and outlets throughout the space.
>
> Despite the size of the project, everything was completed in a timely, professional, and fairly priced manner. The electricians were knowledgeable, efficient, and clearly took pride in their work, and the quality shows.
>
> The office staff also deserves a huge shoutout — scheduling was seamless, and they were incredibly helpful and responsive with any questions we had along the way. Their communication made the entire process smooth and stress-free.
>
> I highly recommend Moore Electric Inc. to anyone looking for a trustworthy, professional electrical company. We couldn't be happier with the results!

*January 2026*

> We couldn't have asked for a better experience with Brenden Moore Electric. Brenden installed two outdoor heaters for our patio/gazebo - and ended up installing a subpanel for us as well 😆
>
> From the start, Brenden took the time to talk us through all of our options for expanding our electrical panel. I really appreciated how clearly he explained everything so I could make an informed decision. He was friendly, kind, and honest about what we needed (and didn't need), and he never once tried to upsell or make the process feel salesy. He even helped explain how a subpanel could benefit us long-term with what we're building.
>
> Brenden and his coworker were efficient, fast, and very respectful of our time and schedule. When one of the heaters stopped working after about an hour (of course 🤦‍♀️), Brenden came back out as soon as possible to check the wiring. Once we determined it was an issue with the unit itself, he returned again to replace and reinstall the new heater for us.
>
> The work is exceptionally professional, and the entire experience was smooth, respectful, and stress-free. We're so grateful and would absolutely recommend Brenden Moore Electric to anyone.
