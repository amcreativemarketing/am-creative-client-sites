## Site Architecture Strategy

### Core Principle
**Build depth before width.** Service expertise pages establish topical authority first; location pages layer on top for local SEO. This prevents thin content penalties, consolidates ranking signals, and creates a scalable foundation.

### Page Hierarchy
Homepage → Core Service Pages → Service Depth Pages → Location Pages → Blog/Content

Each layer supports the one above it. Skipping layers or building out of order dilutes authority and creates weak pages competing against each other.

### URL Structure Standards

| Page Type | URL Pattern | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Core Service | `/[service-name]/` | `/kitchen-remodeling/` |
| Service Depth | `/[specific-service]/` | `/second-story-additions/` |
| Location | `/areas-we-serve/[city]/` | `/areas-we-serve/newburyport/` |
| Future Location+Service | `/areas-we-serve/[city]/[service]/` | `/areas-we-serve/newburyport/kitchen-remodeling/` |

### Content Depth Guidelines

- **Core Service Pages:** 1,500-2,500 words - Comprehensive overview, process explanation, project examples, FAQ, testimonials, related services links
- **Service Depth Pages:** 1,000-1,500 words - Specific focus, cost considerations, decision factors, project examples, links back to parent service page
- **Location Pages:** 800-1,200 words - Area-specific content, local project examples, community connection, links to ALL services, local testimonials

## Page Rollout Plan

### Phase 1: Core Service Pages (In Progress)
| Page | URL Path | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| Home Additions | `/home-additions/` | Parent page for all addition types; captures 'home addition contractor' searches |
| Whole Home Remodeling | `/whole-home-remodeling/` | Highest project value; captures 'whole house renovation' intent |

### Phase 2: Service Depth Pages (Next Priority)
| Page | URL Path | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| Second Story Additions | `/second-story-additions/` | Tracked keyword; specific high-intent search with serious buyers |
| In-Law Suites | `/in-law-suites/` | VoC validated; ADU/multigenerational trend; aging demographic |
| First Floor Master Suites | `/first-floor-master-suites/` | Targets 50-60 segment; aging-in-place planning |
| Historic Home Renovations | `/historic-home-renovations/` | Market differentiator; Newburyport historic housing stock |

### Phase 3: Location Pages (After Service Depth)
| Page | URL Path | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| Newburyport | `/areas-we-serve/newburyport/` | Primary market; local pack rankings |
| Amesbury | `/areas-we-serve/amesbury/` | Office location; home base credibility |
| West Newbury | `/areas-we-serve/west-newbury/` | High-income area; less competitive |

### Phase 4: Process/Trust Page
| Page | URL Path | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| Design-Build Process | `/design-build-process/` | Captures research searches; addresses VoC process fears |

## On-Page Requirements

Every service page should include:

- **Location modifiers in subheadings** - e.g., "Kitchen Remodeling for North Shore Homes"
- **FAQ schema with local questions** - e.g., "How much does a kitchen remodel cost in Newburyport?"
- **Internal links to related services** - Cross-link between service types, link depth pages to parent pages
- **Internal links to location pages** - Once location pages exist
- **Social proof** - Project examples, testimonials addressing VoC fears (trust, process, outcomes)
- **Clear CTA** - Consultation scheduling that addresses "stress-free process" desire

---

## Technical Notes

- **CMS:** WordPress with Divi theme
- **Page Context:** Most pages sit below existing hero (H1/H2) and above footer
- **Schema:** LocalBusiness on all pages, Service schema on service pages, FAQ schema where applicable

---

## Strategic Rationale

### Why depth before geographic expansion
A site with 4 strong service pages and 4 supporting depth pages will outrank a site with 4 service pages and 12 thin location variations. Google sees the first as an authority; the second as keyword stuffing.

### Why general location pages first
At BLB's current site size and authority level, one comprehensive Newburyport page that links to all services concentrates ranking signals. Six thin "Service + Newburyport" pages split that authority six ways.

### When to create location-specific service pages
Location-service combo pages (e.g., "Kitchen Remodeling Newburyport") make sense only when:
1. Core service pages are ranking and building authority
2. GBP presence is strong in that market
3. There's enough unique local content to differentiate (local project photos, area-specific testimonials, neighborhood considerations)
